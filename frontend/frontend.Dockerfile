# =============================================================================
# Multi-stage build for the Ticket Project React frontend.
#
# Stage 1 (build): uses Node 24 to install dependencies (npm ci) and build
#                  the static production bundle with Vite.
# Stage 2 (run):   a slim nginx image that serves the built static files.
#                  The /api/* path is NOT handled here; Caddy routes API
#                  requests directly to the backend, so nginx only serves
#                  static assets and provides SPA fallback routing.
