# =============================================================================
# Multi-stage build for the Ticket Project Spring Boot backend (Java 25).
#
# Stage 1 (build): uses the Temurin 25 JDK and the project's Maven wrapper to
#                  compile and package the application, skipping tests.
# Stage 2 (run):   a slim Temurin 25 JRE image that only contains the
#                  executable jar.
#
# Secrets are NOT baked into the image; they are injected at runtime via
# environment variables (see compose.yaml and application-docker.properties).
# The gitignored local application.properties is excluded via .dockerignore.
