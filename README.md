## Running on a Home-Network Server (Docker Compose)

This project ships with a Docker Compose stack so you can run the entire
application (MariaDB, Mailpit, the Spring Boot backend, the React frontend,
and an HTTPS reverse proxy using Caddy) on a dedicated machine on your home
network and reach it from any device (phones, laptops) over Wi-Fi.

This is useful for:

- Testing the app on multiple devices.
- Opening the emails your app sends (including ticket QR codes) directly on
  your phone via Mailpit's web UI, instead of copying files around by hand.
- Reproducible, automated setup of every dependency.

### One-time host preparation

1. Install Docker Engine and the Compose plugin using the Docker installation script:
   ```
   # Download the script
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh
   # Verify the script's content
   cat install-docker.sh
   # Run the script with --dry-run to verify the steps it executes
   sh install-docker.sh --dry-run
   # Run the script either as root or using sudo to perform the installation
   sudo sh install-docker.sh
   ```
2. Install `mkcert` (and the NSS tools it needs):
   ```
   sudo apt install -y mkcert libnss3-tools
   ```
3. (Recommended) Give this machine a hostname other devices can resolve over
   mDNS, e.g. `ticketproject.local`. On Ubuntu/Debian, install Avahi and set
   the hostname to match `SITE_HOST` in `.env`:
   ```
   sudo apt install -y avahi-daemon
   ```
4. (Recommended) Reserve this machine's IP address in your router's DHCP
   settings so it does not change.

### First-time setup

From the repository root:

```
make bootstrap   # generates .env secrets + TLS certificates
make build       # builds the backend and frontend images
make up          # starts the whole stack
```

### Trusting the certificate on your devices

`make bootstrap` prints the path to mkcert's root CA (`rootCA.pem`). Install
that CA on each device you want to test from so they trust
`https://ticketproject.local` (or whatever else you set your hostname to):

- **Android:** Settings → Security → Install certificate (choose user CA).
- **iOS:** Install the profile, then enable full trust under
  Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings.

Once trusted, `https://ticketproject.local` (or `https://whatever_else_your_hostname_is`)
is a secure context, so the camera-based QR ticket scanner works on your phone.

### Using it

Assuming your chosen hostname is `ticketproject.local`:

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| App (HTTPS) | `https://ticketproject.local` |
| Mailpit web UI (emails + QR codes) | `http://ticketproject.local:8025` |
| Swagger API docs | `https://ticketproject.local/swagger-ui/index.html` |

Manage the stack with `make status`, `make logs`, `make down`, and
`make restart`. Run `make help` to list all targets.

> Secrets live in the gitignored `.env` file. Delete it and re-run
> `make bootstrap` only if you want fresh secrets (this does NOT delete
> database data; use `make clean` for that).

## Local Development Setup (without Docker)

1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine.
2. Create a MariaDB database on your local machine.
3. Use the following command to generate three secret encryption
keys in Base64 encoding. They will be used by the application for
encrypting/decrypting sensitive information stored in some database
tables, as well as for computing blind indexes:

```
openssl rand -base64 32
```

4. If the file `src/main/resources/application.properties`
doesn't already exist, create it with the following contents:

```
# Add this line to the top of the file
spring.application.name=webapp

# If you're running this application locally,
# you can set this to http://localhost:8080
app.config.base-url=base_url_to_your_machine
# If you're running this application locally,
# you can set this to http://localhost:5173
app.config.frontend-base-url=base_url_to_your_frontend_machine

# Add your MariaDB database name, username and password
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

# MariaDB Driver
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver

# update -> update schema to match entities
# create -> drop all tables and recreate them on every startup
# create-drop -> like create, but also drops on shutdown
# validate -> check if entities match the schema, throw an error if there's a mismatch
# none -> do nothing
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# JPA options (feel free to edit as you wish)
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MariaDBDialect

# For encrypting and encrypting database fields with sensitive information
app.encryption.key-base64=your_first_base64_encoded_secret_key_goes_here
# For computing blind indexes
app.blind-index.key-base64=your_second_base64_encoded_secret_key_goes_here
# For signing and authenticating JSON Web Tokens.
app.jwt.secret-base64=your_third_base64_encoded_secret_key_goes_here

# SMTP server config used by this application to send out emails to users
spring.mail.host=your_smtp_hostname_goes_here
spring.mail.port=your_smtp_port_goes_here
spring.mail.username=your_smtp_username_goes_here
spring.mail.password=your_smtp_password_goes_here
# Enable/disable SMTP authentication.
# Set this to true or false based on your needs.
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true_or_false
# Enable/disable StartTLS encryption.
# Set this to true or false based on your needs.
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true_or_false
```

5. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory and run this command
to install the application's frontend dependencies:
```
npm ci
```

6a. To run the application's backend, use this command:
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

6b. To run the application's backend tests, use this command:
```
./mvnw test
```

6c. To run the application's frontend, use this command:
```
npm run dev
```

## Project Dependencies:
For backend dependencies, see `pom.xml`.
For frontend dependencies, see `frontend/package.json`
and `frontend/package-lock.json`.

## API Documentation:
After starting the application, replace the word `server` in any of
the below links with the server name or IP address of the machine
which this application's backend is running on (if you are running this
application locally, then `server` would be replaced with `localhost`),
then navigate to the link of your choice to view the API documentation
in your desired format.

- JSON Format: <http://server:8080/v3/api-docs>
- YAML Format: <http://server:8080/v3/api-docs.yaml>
